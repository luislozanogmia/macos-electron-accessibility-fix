‚úÖ Supported Applications
AI Desktop Apps: Claude Desktop ‚Ä¢ ChatGPT Desktop ‚Ä¢ Cursor
Communication: Slack ‚Ä¢ Discord ‚Ä¢ Microsoft Teams
Productivity: Notion ‚Ä¢ Obsidian ‚Ä¢ Figma Desktop
Development: VS Code variants ‚Ä¢ Electron-based IDEs

üéØ The Problem
Automation tools consistently fail when accessing UI elements in Electron applications on macOS with error -25212 (kAXErrorCannotComplete):

‚ùå Works in testing, fails in production ‚Üê If this is happening to you, this repository solves it
‚ùå 60-80% failure rates in tested environments
‚ùå Manual warm-up scripts needed before automation
‚ùå No reliable programmatic solution existed... until now

üí° The Solution
Session-persistent accessibility state initialization that creates reliable automation from application startup.
Before This Fix:
python# Typical automation attempt
element = get_ui_element("Claude Desktop", "Send button")
# ‚ùå Error -25212: kAXErrorCannotComplete
After This Fix:
python# Initialize once during startup
initialize_macos_accessibility()

# Now automation works reliably
element = get_ui_element("Claude Desktop", "Send button")  
# ‚úÖ Success: Returns proper UI element
üöÄ Quick Start
Option 1: Standalone Script
bash# Download and run the initializer
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luislozanogmia/macos-electron-accessibility-fix/main/src/macos_ax_initializer.py
python macos_ax_initializer.py
Option 2: Library Integration
pythonfrom ax_session_initializer import initialize_macos_accessibility

# Add to your application startup
def main():
    # Initialize accessibility state for target apps
    initialize_macos_accessibility()
    
    # Your automation now works reliably
    your_automation_code()
Option 3: FastAPI/Web App Integration
python@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    # Initialize all components including accessibility
    success = initialize_macos_accessibility()
    if success:
        print("üîß Accessibility state initialized")

üìä Results
Before Fix
Success rate: 20-40%
Reliability: Unreliable

After Fix
Success rate: 99%
Reliability: Deterministic


üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
Technical Insight: Electron applications require session-level accessibility tree initialization that persists beyond individual API calls. This fix triggers the necessary macOS accessibility system calls during startup, creating persistent state that enables reliable automation.
Root Cause: The macOS accessibility system uses lazy initialization that isn't automatically triggered when Electron apps launch, leading to the notorious -25212 error.
